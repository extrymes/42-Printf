# 42-Printf
## Overview
The **ft_printf** project from **42 School** involves recreating the standard C library function `printf()`. It focuses on building a formatted output function that handles multiple data types and provides formatted string output. This project helps build a deeper understanding of variadic functions, format specifiers, and output formatting in C.

## Getting started
There is no excutable for this project, you just need to make and use the function in your code.
> If you are on macOS, make sure you have installed **Xcode Command Line Tools**.
1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/extrymes/42-Printf.git
cd 42-Printf
```
2. Include the header file in your code
```c
#include "path/to/ft_printf.h"
```
3. Make and add the archive to your program compilation
```bash
make
cc <file.c> libftprintf.a
```
You can compile `ft_printf_tests.c` to test the function.
